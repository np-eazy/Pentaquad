Pentaquad is a web game of a more complex Tetris variant, which features different gravity modes and objectives for clearing
specific targets rather than filled lines in the original game.

Start game: like any other React App(); npm run start and open localhost:3000

Controls
- Click: Toggle whether or not the piece follows the cursor position
- W: move piece up
- A: move piece left
- S: move piece down
- D: move piece right
- For WASD controls, if going in the opposite direction of the falling direction, the piece rotates right instead.

- Space: drop the current piece towards its boundary
- Q: rotate piece left 
- E: rotate piece right
- F: flip the piece 
- R: place the piece in mid-air
- C: hold the current piece, if a piece is already held then swap that one in. A block must be placed before this can happen again

Game Rules 
- Basically Tetris, but pieces are 5 blocks large and alternate by falling down or to the right. This makes for more complex thinking/structures than the original game, with room for more interesting objectives.
- A row or column can be fully cleared if it is fully filled, but it will only clear if it is perpendicular to the current gravity.
- Overtime, target blocks spawn starting from a 2x2 size. Target blocks need to be filled quickly, otherwise they will grow larger.
- Once a target block covers the whole board, the game is over. As of now, GameOver is not implemented since the current version is mostly a demo of mechanisms and potential gameplay.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
